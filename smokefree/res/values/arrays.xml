        <item>Your blood pressure, pulse rate and the temperature of your hands and feet have returned to normal.</item>
        <item>Remaining nicotine in your bloodstream will have fallen to 6.25PERCENT of normal peak daily levels, a 93.75PERCENT reduction.</item>
        <item>Your blood oxygen level will have increased to normal and carbon monoxide levels will have dropped to normal.</item>
        <item>Anxieties have peaked in intensity and within two weeks should return to near pre-cessation levels.</item>
        <item>Damaged nerve endings have started to regrow and your sense of smell and taste are beginning to return to normal. Cessation anger and irritability will have peaked.</item>
        <item>Your entire body will test 100PERCENT nicotine-free and over 90PERCENT of all nicotine metabolites (the chemicals it breaks down into) will now have passed from your body via your urine.Â Symptoms of chemical withdrawal have peaked in intensity, including restlessness. The number of cue induced crave episodes experienced during any quitting day will peak for the &quot;average&quot; ex-user. Lung bronchial tubes leading to air sacs (alveoli) are beginning to relax in recovering smokers. Breathing is becoming easier and the lungSINGLEQUOTEs functional abilities are starting to increase.</item>
        <item>The &quot;average&quot; ex-smoker will encounter an &quot;average&quot; of three cue induced crave episodes per day. Although we may not be &quot;average&quot; and although serious cessation time distortion can make minutes feel like hours, it is unlikely that any single episode will last longer than 3 minutes. Keep a clock handy and time them.</item>
        <item>10 days - The &quot;average&quot; ex-user is down to encountering less than two crave episodes per day, each less than 3 minutes.</item>
        <item>Recovery has likely progressed to the point where your addiction is no longer doing the talking. Blood circulation in your gums and teeth are now similar to that of a non-user.</item>
        <item>Cessation related anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, restlessness and depression have ended. If still experiencing any of these symptoms get seen and evaluated by your physician.</item>
        <item>Brain acetylcholine receptor counts that were up-regulated in response to nicotineSINGLEQUOTEs presence have now down-regulated and receptor binding has returned to levels seen in the brains of non-smokers.</item>
        <item>Brain acetylcholine receptor counts that were up-regulated in response to nicotineSINGLEQUOTEs presence have now down-regulated and receptor binding has returned to levels seen in the brains of non-smokers.</item>
        <item>Your heart attack risk has started to drop. Your lung function is beginning to improve.</item>
        <item>Your circulation has substantially improved. Walking has become easier. Your chronic cough, if any, has likely disappeared. If not, get seen by a doctor, and sooner if at all concerned, as a chronic cough can be a sign of lung cancer.</item>
        <item>Insulin resistance in smokers has normalized despite average weight gain of 2.7 kg.</item>
        <item>Any smoking related sinus congestion, fatigue or shortness of breath have decreased. Cilia have regrown in your lungs, thereby increasing their ability to handle mucus, keep your lungs clean and reduce infections. Your bodySINGLEQUOTEs overall energy has increased.</item>
        <item>Your excess risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke have dropped to less than half that of a smoker.</item>
        <item>Your risk of a subarachnoid haemorrhage has declined to 59PERCENT of your risk while still smoking. If a female ex-smoker, your risk of developing diabetes is now that of a non-smoker.</item>
